# vorne_signboard

This is a simple python class for controlling a Vorne M1000 LED Display Signboard.

Currently Vorne provides a Windows and MSDOS executable, and Serial communication protocol documentation.

The LED display uses an RS232 connection for control. There's also an option for 
wireless control, that is not currently in scope for this project.
